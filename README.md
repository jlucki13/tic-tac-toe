Description: A Tic-Tac-Toe Game to Play 

Roadmap to Future Improvements: The first improvement I would like to make is a feature that stops the game completely once a player has won. I will do this by writing a conditional statement that checks to see if any of the winning array combinations have been achieved. However, it will only check this on turns 5-9 because no winner can occur before turn 5. Then, once the game is stopped and a player has won, a "Reset Game" button will appear at the bottom to reset the board and allow the game to play again. 

The next improvement I will make is the background color of the squares. Instead of changing the font color of "X" and "O" I would like for the default background to stay blue and indicate the square has not yet been picked, and then once picked update with a green or red color for each player depending upon if they are "X" or "O". This could be simply done by updating the styles.css code.
